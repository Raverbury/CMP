# CMP
Custom Music Player, mainly for seamlessly playing looped soundtracks

# Installation
* Requires JRE
## Windows
* Clone or download this repo to your machine, run the build script (make_jar.bat)
* Run the newly created .jar file

# Features
* Track are your regular .wav files, nothing more. Can be a song or your neighbor's lawnmower sounds, whatever
* Flavors are configurations for your tracks. They contain the loop start and ending point. A track can contain many flavors
* All are editable. You can add, remove, edit tracks/flavors, all within resources/metadata.json
* This repo comes with some tracks and flavors for demonstration purposes

# Why
So you know those joke/meme edits of songs with weird gimmicks yeah?

Like this [rickroll, but it never starts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvh0nX08nRw)

Or this [Crab Rave But The Beat Never Drops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTZk3pwObmI) (actually I don't listen to this, like ever)

Or just normal game soundtrack looping seamlessly without any awkward fade/silence inbetween?

Yeah your average Windows Media Player or VLC can't do something like that, but CMP was built with those purposes in mind
