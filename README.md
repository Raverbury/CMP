# CMP
Custom Music Player, mainly for seamlessly playing looped soundtracks

# Installation
* Requires JRE
## Windows
* Clone or download this repo to your machine, run the build script (make_jar.bat)
* Run the newly created .jar file

# Features
* Track are your regular .wav files, nothing more. Can be a song or your neighbor's lawnmower sounds, whatever
* Flavors are configurations for your tracks. They contain the loop start and ending point. A track can contain many flavors
* All are editable. You can add, remove, edit tracks/flavors, all within resources/metadata.json
* This repo comes with some tracks and flavors for demonstration purposes

# Why
So you know those joke/meme edits of songs with weird gimmicks yeah?

Like this [rickroll, but it never starts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvh0nX08nRw)

Or this [Crab Rave But The Beat Never Drops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTZk3pwObmI) (actually I don't listen to this, like ever)

Or just normal game soundtrack looping seamlessly without any awkward fade/silence inbetween?

Yeah your average Windows Media Player or VLC can't do something like that, but CMP was built with those purposes in mind
Then just use Youtube you say? Nice try but only the content of the video is looped properly because that's the intention of the uploader, Youtube itself can't seamlessly loop its own videos. And you are using internet data to do that
